# Final Submission Checklist

## ✅ Before Running Tests

- [ ] Install dependencies: `npm install`
- [ ] Install Playwright browsers: `npx playwright install`
- [ ] Verify `.env` file has Admin credentials
- [ ] Delete any existing `test-data.json` file in project root

## ✅ Running the Tests

- [ ] Run tests: `npm test`
- [ ] Wait for all tests to complete (12 steps across 5 test files)
- [ ] Check console output for success messages
- [ ] Verify `test-data.json` was created with employee details

## ✅ Generating Report

- [ ] Generate HTML report: `npm run test:report`
- [ ] Report should open automatically in browser
- [ ] Verify all tests show status (passed/failed)
- [ ] Check that traces are available for any retries

## ✅ Creating Failure Artifact

### Option 1: Intentional Failure
1. [ ] Open `src/tests/admin.create-employee.spec.ts`
2. [ ] Change an assertion (e.g., change `expect(count).toBeGreaterThan(0)` to `expect(count).toBe(999)`)
3. [ ] Run the specific test: `npx playwright test src/tests/admin.create-employee.spec.ts`
4. [ ] Failure artifacts created in `test-results/` folder
5. [ ] Screenshot and trace.zip will be available
6. [ ] Revert the change

### Option 2: View Existing Traces
- [ ] Check `test-results/` folder for any retry traces
- [ ] Use `npx playwright show-trace test-results/<path>/trace.zip` to view

## ✅ Documentation Review

- [ ] README.md has setup instructions
- [ ] README.md describes project structure
- [ ] README.md lists all features
- [ ] TEST_EXECUTION.md explains test flow
- [ ] REVIEW.md summarizes implementation quality

## ✅ Code Quality Check

- [ ] No TypeScript errors: Run `npx tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] Code formatted: Run `npm run format`
- [ ] All selectors in dedicated files (not in Page Objects)
- [ ] All credentials from environment variables
- [ ] Models have validation
- [ ] Repository pattern implemented

## ✅ GitHub Repository Preparation

- [ ] Initialize git: `git init`
- [ ] Add all files: `git add .`
- [ ] Commit: `git commit -m "Initial commit: OrangeHRM test automation suite"`
- [ ] Create GitHub repository (make it public)
- [ ] Add remote: `git remote add origin <your-repo-url>`
- [ ] Push: `git push -u origin main`

## ✅ Final Repository Contents

## 🚀 Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Install
npm install
npx playwright install

# Run tests
npm test                          # All tests
npm run test:headed               # With browser visible
npm run test:ui                   # Interactive mode

# Reports
npm run test:report               # Open HTML report

# Format code
npm run format                    # Run Prettier

# Debug
npx playwright test --debug       # Debug mode
npx playwright show-trace <file>  # View trace
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Test Execution Order**: Tests MUST run in sequence as they depend on each other
2. **Test Data**: `test-data.json` stores employee details between tests
3. **Supervisor**: Demo uses Admin as supervisor (real scenario would create one)
4. **Timing**: First run may take longer as browser downloads
5. **Network**: Stable internet required for OrangeHRM demo site
